# POWER-BI-DASHBOARD-PROJECT
THIS IS A POWER BI END TO END PROJECT
My First Power BI Dashboard!

I'm excited to share my journey into data visualization with my first Power BI project - an e-commerce sales dashboard! Using sales data, I explored key business metrics to uncover insights and trends.

What the dashboard highlights:

1. Profit Trends: Monthly profit that identifies high-performing and challenging months.

2. Key categories and products: Key contributors to sales and profitability.

3. Customer insights: Payment preferences and key customer status.

4. Geographic Breakdown: Sales distribution across regions.

Key Takeaways:

a) Clothing drives 63% of the total quantity sold.

b) Printers are the top profit-generating product, contributing 8.6K in profits.

c) Maharashtra ranks first in total sales with revenue of 102,000.

Why choose Power BI? Power BI interaction and flexibility allow me to transform the original data into meaningful stories. This project teaches me:

Develop the meaning of user-friendly visual effects.

How to effectively use slicers and filters to make your dashboard dynamic.

The value of data to drive business decisions.

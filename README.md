# POWER-BI-DASHBOARD-PROJECT
THIS IS A POWER BI END TO END PROJECT
My First Power BI Dashboard!

I'm excited to share my journey into data visualization with my first Power BI project - an e-commerce sales dashboard! Using sales data, I explored key business metrics to uncover insights and trends.

What the dashboard highlights:

1. Profit Trends: Monthly profit that identifies high-performing and challenging months.

2. Key categories and products: Key contributors to sales and profitability.

3. Customer insights: Payment preferences and key customer status.

4. Geographic Breakdown: Sales distribution across regions.
